This directory will always contain the most recent installer:
https://github.com/bongochong/CWP-Utilities/raw/master/Releases/CWP-Utilities-Stable-1.7.7.exe
*You should also ALWAYS execute option number 15 in the console interface after installing, to ensure that the CWPU scripts are synced with the latest versions in this repository. Option number 15 should be executed once every week or two as well, for good measure.*

It will also contain a zip file of the program for those who prefer not to use an installer:
https://github.com/bongochong/CWP-Utilities/raw/master/Releases/CWP-Utilities.zip
Without the installer, you won't have the benefit of a variety of handy shortcuts, but the program can still be launched via 'CWPU-Tray.exe' or 'LauncherLauncher.bat'.

If you need to download an old one for some crazy reason, you may check here:
