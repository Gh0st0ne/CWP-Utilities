This directory will always contain the most recent installer:
https://github.com/bongochong/CWP-Utilities/raw/master/Releases/CWP-Utilities-Stable-1.7.6.exe

It will also contain a zip file of the program for those who prefer not to use an installer:
https://github.com/bongochong/CWP-Utilities/raw/master/Releases/CWP-Utilities.zip
Without the installer, you won't have the benefit of a variety of handy shortcuts, but the program can still be launched via 'CWPU-Tray.exe' or 'LauncherLauncher.bat'.

If you need to download an old one for some crazy reason, you may check here:
