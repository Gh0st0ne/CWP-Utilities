**Changelog**:

05/13/2019 - Smarter directory structure. Leaner and meaner. Takes up a lot less space. Reduced installer size drastically as well. Also added a little utility that can restore your default hosts file (it can be found in the `docs` folder of the install directory, and must be run as administrator). This is now release candidate 1, and you can download it from here: [CWP-Utilities-Installer-RC-1.exe](https://github.com/bongochong/CWP-Utilities/raw/master/Releases/CWP-Utilities-Installer-RC-1.exe) **PLEASE uninstall the old version** before installing this one. This is necessary because the directory structure has changed. It's worth it.
